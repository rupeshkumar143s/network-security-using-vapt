# network-security-using-vapt
The project is about creating a Python script that automates vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) by integrating Nmap and Wapiti tools. The script uses the python-nmap library to automate Nmap scans and wapiti command-line tool to scan web applications. It generates a report of vulnerabilities detected by both tools in various formats. This project aims to streamline and automate the VAPT process by combining two powerful tools into a single script.
